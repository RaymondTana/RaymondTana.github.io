I received bachelors of sciences in both Physics and Mathematics as an undergraduate at Penn State, with honors in Mathematics through the Schreyer Honors College. 

## MASS Program

As a sophomore, I participated in my first semester with MASS, an advanced semester of mathematical courses hosted by Penn State faculty that focuses on three unique subjects within Analysis, Algebra, and Geometry. I graduated with distinction from that program, as well as with a Best Project Presentation in Algebra and Best Overall Performance. The following year, I returned to taking a course on Elliptic Functions and Curves in the MASS program, again achieving the Best Project in Algebra. â€‹

## REU at Auburn University

In 2018, I participated in the Auburn University Mathematics REU, where I developed an alternative means of classifying and identifying algebraic groups based on their achievement sets and achieving sets. These two notions were inspired by the work of R. Jones on Achievement Sets of Sequences over the reals.

## Undergraduate Thesis

I completed an undergraduate honors thesis under the guidance of Dr. Sergei Tabachnikov, who introduced the notion of Symplectic Billiards. My thesis used computer simulations and some new simplifications to analyze this dynamical system on general quadrilaterals.
