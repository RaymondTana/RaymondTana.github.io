I have taught various courses at Penn State, including on Multivariable Calculus, Game Theory, and even Sustainability! 

## My Courses and Projects
I have dedicated pages for each of the courses I've taught, as well as the accessibility-related coding project I worked on for Penn State:
- [MATH_033: Math for Sustainability](pages/MATH_033.html)
- [MATH_230: Multivariable Calculus](pages/MATH_230.html)
- [MATH_486: Game Theory](pages/MATH_486.html)
- [Accessibility](pages/Accessibility.html)

## Teaching Experience
As of October 2023, I now possess the Penn State Mathematics Department's [Teaching Associate Status](https://science.psu.edu/math/graduate/teaching-in-math#:~:text=Teaching%20Associate%20Status), which reflects a distinguished completion of my graduate teaching assistant training program and for having shown a record of successful classroom teaching.

I have taught 7 sections of MATH 033 as the principal instructor; 2 sections of MATH 033 as a co-instructor; 1 section of MATH 230 as the principal instructor; 1 section of MATH 486 as a co-instructor; and 2 sections of MATH 486 as the teaching assistant.

I'm quoted in the following article on [MATH 033: Mathematics for Sustainability](https://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/using-sustainability-make-introductory-stem-courses-meaningful/).

I have also worked with Dr. Jan Reimann and other graduate students in creating a new, open-source suite of projects to make math education at Penn State more accessible and affordable using HTML, Jupyter, and Python.  You can read more about this project [here](/projects/pages/Calculus_with_Jupyter.html).

## Recognition

I've received:
- The 2023-2024 Department of Mathematics [Charles H. Hoover Memorial Award](https://arc.net/l/quote/ujzlnxbz) in recognition of outstanding undergraduate teaching by a graduate teaching assistant. 
- The 2021-2022 Department of Mathematics Teaching Award through the Penn State Math Department (more specifically, the Robert and Betsy Wilson Endowed Scholarship).

## Resources for Students
Students across my MATH 033 sections from 2021-2024 collectively built this [list of resources available to students](https://science.psu.edu/math/people/rjf5371#:~:text=link%20to%20a%20list%20of%20resources%20available%20to%20students) dealing with housing, food, clothing, transportation, funding, or health insecurities in the State College area. Feel free to distribute. 

I aim to provide a safe space for all students of all races, abilities, sexual & romantic orientations, genders, religions, ages, nationalities, and ideologies. 

## English as a Second Language
I have also taught English as a Second Language (ESL) while volunteering in the State College area to native Spanish speakers through the [Mid-State Literacy Council](https://www.mid-stateliteracycouncil.org/). I did this for over three years, or six semesters.
