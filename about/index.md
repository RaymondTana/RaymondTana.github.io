## Roles
- I have taught various courses at Penn State, including [MATH 033: Mathematics for Sustainability](https://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/using-sustainability-make-introductory-stem-courses-meaningful/), (I'm quoted in the linked article), MATH 230: Calculus and Vector Analysis, and MATH 486: Mathematical Theory of Games
- I have served as the Graduate Chair on the [Eberly College of Science Sustainability Council](https://science.psu.edu/about/leadership/sustainability-council) for the last four full academic years.
- I also served as the leader for the Carbon Neutral Working Group with the Student Sustainability Advisory Council (SSAC) for two academic years. Here is a [presentation of our final recommendations from Fall 2021](https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/SSAC2021-202257/EV5n9seAeaZHmW0KhekxhToBwIBxW7bnfDPO_naWxsAj_Q?e=cCuToc). I was [interviewed about my sustainability advocacy](https://medium.com/statecollegespark/students-advocate-for-a-greener-campus-7e42883a7c5e) by Ava Klink for SPARK. 
- I am a member of the [Penn State Logic Group](https://logic.math.psu.edu/) headed by Jan Reimann and Linda Westrick. We meet weekly for 1.5 hours in our Logic Seminar to talk about current topics and have an internal or external speaker present. 
- I am a co-founding member of the Penn State Quantum Information and Computation Club.

## Projects
- My main thread of research focuses on effective fractal dimension and applications to fractal geometry. Conditional complexity, how effective dimension behaves under geometric transformations, and information extraction. 
- I work with Dr. Jan Reimann and other graduate students in creating a new, open-source suite of projects to make math education at Penn State more accessible and affordable using HTML, Jupyter, and Python. Here is an example of our new [MATH 110: Techniques of Calculus textbook](https://28left.github.io/110jupyter/intro.html) deployed Fall 2021.
- I produced the first ever [Eberly College of Science Greenhouse Gas Inventory](https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/sites/PennStateEberlyCollegeofScienceSustainabilityCouncil/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FPennStateEberlyCollegeofScienceSustainabilityCouncil%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2021%20ECoS%20GHG%20Emissions%20Inventory%2FECoS%5FGHG%5FInventory%5FCY2019%5FReport%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FPennStateEberlyCollegeofScienceSustainabilityCouncil%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2F2021%20ECoS%20GHG%20Emissions%20Inventory&p=true&ga=1), quantifying the annual emissions related to all of Penn State's Eberly College of Science activities and operations. This was the most ambitious inventory effort performed at Penn State, and has served as a template for various other colleges and units at the university to produce their own inventories. My inventory further recommends methods for decarbonization, offset, and strategic planning to counteract our current emissions. I personally have helped produced unit-level inventories for the University Libraries and the College of Health and Human Development. Eberly College's Science Journal 2022 Issue 2 featured an [exposition](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/2022-issue-2/graduate-student-connects-math-with-green-advocacy?fbclid=IwAR2Jc585LSxNee-2zQ69X0lt_gJJwKT_w3hDyDTWe2D_tR7b3hPta-9HKuo) on this project. 
- I also produced the first ever [Council of Commonwealth Student Governments Lifetime Greenhouse Gas Inventory](https://github.com/RaymondFriend/CCSG_Inventory), quantifying all greenhouse gas emissions produced through all operations committed by Penn State's CCSG (the student government for all commonwealth campuses) in its 60+ year history. This inventory effort was the first performed for any organization at Penn State, and has inspired other student governments to produce their own as well.
- My team and I submitted our final project on [AP Outcomes and University metrics](https://github.com/mcelhens/AP-Outcomes-to-University-Metrics) in completion of the [Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Data Science Bootcamp in December 2024. Check out the [Streamlit app](https://ap-outcomes.streamlit.app/) I created for it!
- I submitted a small project in completion of the 2024 BlueDot Impact AI Alignment Course on [Compression and GenAI](https://bramble-recess-9ca.notion.site/Compression-and-GenAI-d194a60d26ec47d195709593da13513f?pvs=74).
- My team and I were finalists in the 2021 Nittany AI Challenge with our idea [Trace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moRX4Hfn-Yo).
- I advised and co-lead a finalist team in the 2022 Nittany AI Challenge named Stellar AI.
- I have written a [research report](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7088496715963482112/) in Portuguese about Ethnomathematics and the mathematical practices found in indigenous Brazilian practices. 

## Mathematical and Professional Experiences
- I completed the Data Science bootcamp from the [Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) during Fall 2024. I TA'd for the same bootcamp the following semester in Spring 2025.
