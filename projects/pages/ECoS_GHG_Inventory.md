title: "Eberly College of Science 2019 Greenhouse Gas Inventory"
nav_exclude: true
---

The Eberly College of Science produced $28,152$ metric tons of CO2-equivalent through its various operations during Calendar Year 2019.

Our greenhouse gas inventory presented a breakdown of emissions arising from utility use, air travel, commuting, Fleet leased and rented vehicles, vended supplies, high performance computing, and other sources. This report was the first work of its kind for Eberly College of Science, and only the second unit-level GHG inventory to be performed across The Pennsylvania State University.

We recommended that the College repeat this inventory on a regular basis as a metric of success in reducing its emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases and urge college leaders to explore the opportunities for action. Achieving greater sustainability and resilience would require a combination of systematic and individual actions across ECoS.
