In an effort to quantify The Penn State University's Council of Commonwealth Student Governments' (CCSG) total carbon-equivalent emissions throughout its entire existence, I was tasked with the responsibility of performing an inventory of every significant source of greenhouse gas emissions related to the student government's activities. This was the first action of this kind by any student organization at Penn State.

Throughout its existence and through its various strategic operations, CCSG has emitted approximately **3104 metric tons of COâ‚‚-equivalent** and continues to output about **87 MtCOâ‚‚e** annually.
