Jupyter Book is a powerful tool to create accessible, free content for students in an alternative mode than traditional textbooks or online, third-party problem tools. Our textbooks contribute to a future for secondary mathematics education (and beyond) that puts the instructors and students at the center of their education. We have incorporated interactive & regenerative question banks, IPython notebooks, and step-by-step tutorials into the typical textbook experience. Meanwhile, we've built a suite of tools to help many courses, subjects, and universities participate in this paradigm shift.

My roles included content creation (both textbook and notebook activities), backend, user experience, and documentation.​
Multiple sections of MATH 110: Techniques of Calculus I at Penn State University Park have already piloted this new resource ever since the Fall 2021 semester.
